\section{Data}
\label{submission}

The dataset used for this study focuses on a range of health-related variables. These include demographic details, lifestyle factors, and numerical medical measurements. Together, these biometric variables enable an analysis of health outcomes, with particular attention to blood pressure. The dataset specifically focuses on patient samples taken in Jamalpur, Bangladesh. 1,529 patient samples are included in the data set, all data was collected from the dates January 20, 2024, to January 1, 2025.\footnote{Nirob, Md Asraful Sharker; Bishshash, Prayma; SIAM, A K M FAZLUL KOBIR ; Haque, Md. Afzalul ; Assaduzzaman, Md (2025), “CAIR-CVD-2025: An Extensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment Dataset from Bangladesh ”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/d9scg7j8fp.1} All data was gathered within ethical guidelines that ensured both patient confidentiality and informed consent.

\subsection{\textbf{Key Variables}}

The key variables used for analysis are Sex, Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), both Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (measured in mmHg), Smoking Status, Diabetes Status and Physical Activity Level. These variables are essential for recognizing risks, determining overall patient health and informing preventive health strategies.


\subsection{\textbf{Data Reading and Preparation for Analysis}}

The data set contains more variables than we require for our analysis and answering our question. We are exploring the data with the hopes of gaining insight into potential factors that affect blood pressure. For the sake of clarity and focus, we are sacrificing analysis of a broad set of variables in favor of narrowing down several key variables to examine the possible relationships that exist between them and blood pressure. Wrangling and tidying the data will be necessary to accomplish this. This means that many variables must be omitted from our final data set on which we will perform EDA and visualization. Also present in most raw data sets are cosmetic blemishes that will complicate our EDA and visualization processes. These include missing observations, straggling commas, random spaces, inconsistent upper/lower case values, and other factors that may complicate how Python processes these observations. So, tidying will be necessary for EDA procedures to work. 

\subsection{\textbf{Data Cleaning}}

Several methods can be used to wrangle and tidy data that is affected by these imperfections. Several packages, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib, will all be essential for our wrangling, tidying, and analysis to take place. Specifically, functions such as df.dropna() (to drop missing values), .str.strip() (to remove spaces), and .str.lower() (to correct lower case letters) will be needed. However, for these things to be carried out, we will first need to coerce them as strings so that they are read correctly and so we can perform the desired operations on them.


\textbf{}



\subsection{Abstract}

The paper abstract should begin in the left column, 0.4~inches below the final
address. The heading `Abstract' should be centered, bold, and in 11~point type.
The abstract body should use 10~point type, with a vertical spacing of
11~points, and should be indented 0.25~inches more than normal on left-hand and
right-hand margins. Insert 0.4~inches of blank space after the body. Keep your
abstract brief and self-contained, limiting it to one paragraph and roughly 4--6
sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the camera-ready phase.

\subsection{Partitioning the Text}

You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
readers place a structure on the material and understand its
contributions.

\subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}

Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
before the heading and 0.15~inches after the heading.

Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and set
in 10~pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.2~inches of space before the heading and 0.13~inches afterward.

Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and
set in 10~pt small caps with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.18~inches of space before the heading and 0.1~inches after the
heading.

Please use no more than three levels of headings.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes
should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper.
Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

Workshops on Machine Learning (ML 1988 -- ML 1992). At the time this figure was
produced, the number of accepted papers for ICML 2008 was unknown and instead
estimated.}
\label{icml-historical}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}

\subsection{Figures}

You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
not appear on a gray background.

Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
figure; instead, the caption should serve this function.

Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and caption
\emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
\cref{icml-historical}. The figure caption should be set in
9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
environments to format pseudocode. These require
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.
\cref{alg:example} shows an example.

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{Bubble Sort}
   \label{alg:example}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$}
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
\cref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
should be flush left.

% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% above and below tabular lines.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{sc}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.1in
\end{table}

Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Theorems and such}
The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:inj}
A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
\end{definition}
Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
\begin{proposition}
If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 
Left as an exercise to the reader. 
\end{proof}
\cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:usefullemma}
For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bigtheorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
\end{theorem}
An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
\begin{corollary}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{assumption}
The set $X$ is finite.
\label{ass:xfinite}
\end{assumption}
\begin{remark}
According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Citations and References}

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic
facility, use \texttt{natbib.sty} and \texttt{icml2025.bst}
included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

Authors should cite their own work in the third person
in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
Please refer to \cref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
cite your own papers.

Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and use a
hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush against the
left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. The references at the
end of this document give examples for journal articles \cite{Samuel59},
conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books
\cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, technical reports
\cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}.

Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
information (e.g., page numbers).

Please put some effort into making references complete, presentable, and
consistent, e.g. use the actual current name of authors.
If using bibtex, please protect capital letters of names and
abbreviations in titles, for example, use \{B\}ayesian or \{L\}ipschitz
in your .bib file.

\section*{Accessibility}
Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

\section*{Software and Data}

If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
when writing their review.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
\section*{Acknowledgements}

\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.

If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
as the following will suffice:

``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{langley00}
